- Prefer Unsigned right shift , instead of normal right shift
- Remember 2'complement and bitwise operators in java
- x & (x-1) resets the first set bit


# Numbers

- Check your solution for 0 and negative numbers
- Look for overflow and use bigger primitive if necessary

# Strings

- Rabin Karp algorithm is efficient for string search and certain palindrome problems
