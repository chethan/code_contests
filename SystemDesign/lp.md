# Customer Obsession
 - Successful leaders always start with the customer and work their way backward. They work hard to earn and maintain customer trust, and even though they pay attention to competitors, customers are always the priority.
# Ownership 
- Leaders think long-term and prioritize long-term value over short-term success. They are owners, and they act on behalf of the company, not just themselves or their own team.
# Invent and Simplify 
- Leaders always seek ways to simplify and always require invention and innovation from their teams. Their thinking has no limits, and they always search for new ideas from everywhere. And, as they try new things, they expect to be sometimes misunderstood.
# Are Right, a Lot 
- Leaders are right most of the time. They possess good instincts and strong judgment, which enables them to seek diverse perspectives.
# Learn and Be Curious 
- Leaders always seek ways to improve themselves and never stop learning. They are curious about new opportunities and aren't afraid to explore the unknown.
# Hire and Develop the Best
 - Every hire and promotion decision made by leaders raises the performance level. Leaders recognize talent and are willing to support them in their development. They invest their time into coaching and mentoring others.
# Insist on the Highest Standards 
- Leaders are continually raising the bar of their standards and motivate their teams 
to deliver high-quality services, products, and processes. 
Leaders make sure that problems are fixed and defects never get sent down the line.
# Think Big 
- Leaders think differently and envisage a bold direction that inspires outstanding results. They also expertly partake in calculated risk-taking. They think outside of the box to serve customers and achieve a significant impact.
# Bias for Action 
- In business, speed matters. Many actions and decisions are reversible and do not require extensive study. They have a bias for action with long-term gains in mind.
# Frugality 
- Leaders find ways to accomplish more with less and maximize profit. They take constraints and turn them into self-sufficiency, resourcefulness, and invention.
# Earn Trust 
- Leaders speak candidly, listen attentively, and treat others respectfully. They aren't afraid to be self-critical in front of others and benchmark themselves only against the best.
# Dive Deep 
- Leaders focus on the details, work at all levels, and audit frequently.
# Have Backbone; Disagree, and Commit 
- Leaders aren't afraid to speak up and challenge decisions in a respectful way whenever they disagree. They do not compromise, even in a challenging environment. And once the team finalizes a decision, these leaders fully commit to it.
# Deliver Results 
- Leaders need to focus on the critical things in their work and deliver quality results promptly.
 No matter what, they overcome obstacles and never settle.
